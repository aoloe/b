bookmarkmanager aka delicious for your own server

:: requirements ::

 * php 5.3+
 * php5-sqlite
 * php5-curl

debian: apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-curl php5-sqlite

:: configuration ::

 * copy files to a directory accessible by the apache-user, like /var/www/b

 * move config.template.php to config.php and edit it
   => baseDir is the directory where the sqlite dbs are stored, e.g. /var/bookmarks/
      the directory must be readable and writeable by the apache-user
   => baseUri is the base uri's relative path param,
      e.g. /b/ if the website is accessible via http://example.com/b/

 * create a new user-account simply by creating a new directory in baseDir:
   mkdir /var/bookmarks/peter/

 * add apache rewriterule:

	<Location /b>
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteBase /
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule . b/index.php [L]
	</Location>

 * protect peter's bookmarks with a password

	<Location /b/peter>
		AuthType Basic
		AuthName b
		AuthUserFile /path/to/htusers
		Require user peter
	</Location>

 * peter's bookmarks should now be accessible via http://example.com/b/peter

:: how to use ::

 * to add a new bookmark, simply paste it into the input field and press
   return. the url may be followed by hash tags, e.g.
   http://example.com #example #bla #wurst

 * the website's title is automatically fetched and the bookmark
   is added to the db.

 * edit title by doubleclicking on it. this opens a prompt-dialog
   where you can edit the title. if you leave the title blank,
   the entry will be removed from the db.

 * edit the url by doubleclicking beside the link.

 * the input field can also be used to filter bookmarks.
   filtering is done with a full-text search on all titles.
